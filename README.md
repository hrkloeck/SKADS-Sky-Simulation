The SKA Design Study Sky Simulations (SKADS)

The SKADS Simulated Skies (S-cubed) are a set of simulations of the radio sky performed at the
University of Oxford (long time ago), suitable for planning science with the Square Kilometer 
Array radio telescope.

Radio continuum: Wilman et al.
Obreschkow et al.


They form part of the SKADS program, which is partly funded by the European Union.
Their purpose is to provide the community with a common testing ground for many of the SKA key
science projects, as well as for instrument design issues on the way to the SKA. Consequently, they
also form an ideal set of simulated skies for SKA pathfinders.

Step 1: Get the simulations

scp -r ftp/s-cubed

Step 2: build a virtual environment via anaconda
install software
matplotlib, astropy, scipy, matplotylib, sqlite

Step 3: Generate a plot of sources
